mm yesn javascrimpt videojuego

this is the repository for an in-browser videogame written in Javascript that can be found at https://voxilon.penguinspy.dev/  
currently it's somewhat remotely playable; i'm still writing the game engine.  
eventually, it'll be a space-exploration-sandbox-automation game with single/mutiplayer and a campaign

This project uses:
- [cannon-es](https://pmndrs.github.io/cannon-es/) for physics
