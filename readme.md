mm yesn javascrimpt videojuego

this is the repository for an in-browser videogame written in Javascript that can be found at https://voxilon.penguinspy.repl.co/  
currently it's not even remotely playable, i'm still writing the game engine.  
eventually, it'll be a space-exploration-sandbox-automation game with single/mutiplayer and a campaign

This project uses:
- [cannon-es](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cannon-es) for physics
- [Quaternion.js](https://github.com/infusion/Quaternion.js/) for... quaternion stuff?
- My own rendering "engine" currently, will likely switch to three.js when I actually need to design the graphics
- [Replit](https://replit.com/@PenguinSpy/Voxilon) for server hosting
